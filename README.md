2 ways to extract text information from pdf for further textual analysis

## Direct Extraction

Set up a OCR project in the [OCR console](https://console.bce.baidu.com/ai/?_=1688458433625#/ai/ocr/app/list) and take down the API Key and Secret Key for the project (shown in the figure below). ![image](https://github.com/StellaElla2023/PDF2TXT/assets/135597395/ddaadd0d-a04c-4f30-a054-5b27291cc3c8)
